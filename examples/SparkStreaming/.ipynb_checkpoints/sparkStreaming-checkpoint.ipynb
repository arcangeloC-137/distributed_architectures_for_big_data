    "# ***Streaming Data Analytics***\n",
    "\n",
    "Act of continuously incorporating new data to compute a result Input data is unbounded → no beginning and no end. The application will output multiple versions of the results as it runs or put them in a storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many important applications must process large streams of live data and provide results in near-real-time:\n",
    "- Social network trends\n",
    "- Website statistics\n",
    "- Intrusion detection systems\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Several frameworks have been proposed to process in real-time or in near real-time data streams:\n",
    "- Apache Spark (Streaming component)\n",
    "- Apache Storm\n",
    "- Amazon Kinensis Streams\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "\n",
    "All these frameworks use a cluster of servers to scale horizontally with respect to the (big) amount of data to be analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two main “solutions”\n",
    "1. **“Continuous”** computation of data streams\n",
    "    - Data are processed as soon as they arrive\n",
    "        - Every time a new record arrives from the input stream, it is immediately processed and a result is emitted as soon as possible\n",
    "    - Real-time processing\n",
    "2. **“Micro-batch”** stream processing\n",
    "    - Input data are collected in micro-batches\n",
    "    - Each micro-batch contains all the data received in a time window (typically less than a few seconds of data)\n",
    "    - One micro-batch a time is processed\n",
    "    - Every time a micro-batch of data is ready, its entire content is processed and a result is emitted\n",
    "    - Near real-time processing\n",
    "    \n",
    "### **Type of precessing**\n",
    "\n",
    "**At-most-once**\n",
    "- Every input element of a stream is processed once or less\n",
    "- It is also called no guarantee\n",
    "- The result **can be wrong/approximated**\n",
    "\n",
    "**At-least-once**\n",
    "- Every input element of a stream is processed once or more\n",
    "- Input elements are replayed when there are failures\n",
    "- The result **can be wrong/approximated**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exactly-once**\n",
    "- Every input element of a stream is processed exactly once\n",
    "- Input elements are replayed when there are failures\n",
    "- If elements have been already processed they are not reprocessed\n",
    "- The result is **always correct**\n",
    "- Slower than the other processing approaches"
